The Washington State Health Ministry would like to optimally upgrade staff or resources in existing
facilities across Washington so that they can allocate resources to where they are most needed, based
on demand for services in different geographic regions/areas.
To address this problem, the health ministry needs to:
• Make services more accessible by allocating resources to where they are most needed;
increasing capacity in some facilities and decreasing capacity in others.
• Minimize people’s travel time so that they only travel to their nearby facility
